Hi there, letâ€™s get back to one of our favorites: [Vossian
Antonomasia](https://vossanto.weltliteratur.net/) (VA).  In [our last
paper](https://weltliteratur.net/vossian-antonomasia-next-level/), we
tried to detect VA automatically using rule-based approaches and a
simple neural network approach. As the neural network approach showed
the best results, we followed this lead and used the big guns in the
field of natural language processing: pre-trained language models.
